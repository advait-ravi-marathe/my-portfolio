    <h1>The best movies I have seen so far</h1>
    <h2>My top three movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>October</h3>
    <p>
      This art film beautifully compares life of a young girl "Shivli" (played
      by Banita Sandhu) with the flower she has been named after. It shows a
      journey of unconditional love and support Shivli gets from his friend Dan
      (played by Varun Dhawan). It is one of the finest performances by Varun
      Dhawan.
    </p>
    <h3>Laila Majnu</h3>
    <p>
      This movie seems like a hopeless romantic film which potrays love story of
      Laila (played by Tripti Dimri) and Qais (played by Avinash Tewary). But
      things start taking turn in the second half when the movie starts
      exploring deeper, more passionate and crazy concepts of love. Again a
      superb performance by one of the underrated gems, Avinash Tewary.

    <h3>Lootera</h3>
    <p>
      This film is set in the pre-independence era and shows love blossoming
      between Pakhi (played by Sonakshi Sinha) and Varun (played by Ranveer
      Singh) when Varun starts living as a tenant in Pakhi's house. However a
      major twist in their lives suddenly brews hate between the two. The film
      beautifully summarises the morale that one should be always optimistic and
      live life to the fullest.
